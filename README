Pass the name of the image file you'd like to modify to ans1.py.  The python script will output a folder named after the image, as well as an html page to view the images in a relatively well-organized order.

For example, at a terminal type: 

'python ans1.py <imagename.jpg>'

At the moment the program only accepts one image as an argument.
